<!--
<img> is a self-closing tag like <br>
image source could be a local file path or an external URL
specify the right path to the image if not in the same folder as the html file
use "../" to go out side the current folder

alt attribute is used to wrtie an alternate text that describes the image,
and it only appears when the source link/path is not recognized

we can rescale an image using width and height attributes
we can use both to set specific dimentions or
one of them and the browser will figure the other one depending on the original scale of the image
if we set dimentions as pixels, the image size will be fixed
if we set dimentions as percentage, the image is responsive to the window size.
