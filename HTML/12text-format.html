        This is <strong>strong text</strong> and this is <b>bold text</b>
    <!-- both strong and bold look the same in the brawser but:
         <b> has no semantic meaning while <strong> does and is used for
         warning situations for example and is recognized by Text-To-Speech reading software -->
        (<strong>Beware:</strong> this is wrong.)

        <br>

        This is <em>emphasis text</em> and this is <i>italic text</i>
    <!-- both emphasis and italic look the same in the brawser but:
         <i> has no semantic meaning while <em> does and can be used for words of special importance and that
         would change the meaning of a sentence if replaced and is recognized by Text-To-Speech reading software -->
        (I need you to <em>listen</em> to me.)

<!--
text format tags are less used bacause we can do the same functionality with CSS.
Using CSS to manipulate spans with classes instead will save time and effort
when I need to change many texts in bold tags for example. I can control all of them from one place.

You should be smart and know when to use the text format tags and when to use CSS instead.
