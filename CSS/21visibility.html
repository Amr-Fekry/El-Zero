<!--
visibility controls the visibilty of an element.
default value: visible.
other value: hidden: hides the element from the page.
recall we also can use (display: none) to hide an element from the page,
but the two properties are different from each other:
(visibilty: hidden) : hides an element but keeping its place in the workflow.
(display: none) : hides an element and removing its place from workflow.
