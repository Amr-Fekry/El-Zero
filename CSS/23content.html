<!--
content property is related to (::before, ::after) pseudo-elements.
and it is used to add content to an element using CSS.
default value: none (no content)

content can take special characters like "\21d2" an arrow.  

any styling inside an elemnt will apply to it and to any pseudo-elements connected.
but, any styling inside a pseudo-element will only apply to its content.

if there is a styling conflect, styling of pseudo-element will override because it is more specific.
