<!--
float property make the elements flow in the workflow.
default value: none
other values:
left: makes the elements flow starting from the left.
right: makes the elements flow starting from the left.

float makes the element take the width of children instead of parent. (if width is not set)
float makes a chiled get out of a parent leaving parent height = 0

(float: left/right) surpasses (direction:ltr/rtl) in that:
with (float: left/right) we can place elements in on both directions on the same line / row / level.
while with (direction:ltr/rtl) each line / row / level can only take one direction.

float also allows for splitting text to both sides of a container. unlike text-align that puts all the text to one side.

after using float on a specific section of the page we need to stop it some how to start a new section without float.
to stop a float, we create a <div style="clear:both"></div> and give it a style property called clear.

clear property ends float property for a specific section and has value of:
clear: right: if our float is right.
clear: left: if our float is left.
clear: both: if we used the two types of float.
