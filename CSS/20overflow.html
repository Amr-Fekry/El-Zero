<!--
overflow describes a child (content) that goes outside the a parent element (workflow) containing it.
default value: visible: overflow can be seen.

other values:

hidden: hides the overflow and it can never be seen (like it doesn't exist)

scroll: adds horizontal and vertical scrolls to parent element so that overflow can be seen.
(problem: adds the scrolls whether there is an overflow or not. scrolls are inactive (bale) until the overflow exists)
if content is text: horizontal scroll is not active until there is a word wider than the parent width. otherwise, text will wrap around.

auto: to avoid scroll problem. it only adds scrolls if needed
____________________________

we can also specify two different types of overflow for the two axis (x,y):
overflow: hidden scroll
overflow: scroll hidden

(when we set one value it applies for both axis)
____________________________

or we can specify overflow for only one axis:
overflow-x: visible/hidden/scroll/auto
overflow-y: visible/hidden/scroll/auto
in this case the other unspecified axis takes a value (auto).
____________________________

when float is used for a children inside a div for example two things happen:
children will get out of parent (div) leaving its height = 0
children will take the width of their children instead of the parent
to fix this problem we can go to the parent and set (overflow: hidden), now parent will take the height of children and wrap them again .
this also fixes another problem, which is: we don't have to clear the float of the children before using another section in the page.
